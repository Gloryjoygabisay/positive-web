# Prologue: Beneath the Birch Tree

In the quiet town of Elmsbrook, nestled at the edge of a thick forest, the birch tree stood like a pale sentinel. Its bark was paper-white, its leaves always whispering secrets to the wind. Every child in Elmsbrook knew not to play near it after dark, but none of them really knew why. Until the night Milo vanished.

# Chapter 1: The Game

It was a humid summer evening, the kind where the sky held the last orange hues of daylight like burning embers. Milo, an adventurous eight-year-old with a knack for mischief, had begged to stay out a little longer. His older sister Tessa, reluctantly in charge, agreed to one last round of hide and seek with their cousins before bedtime.

The children scattered beneath the dimming canopy of trees, laughter echoing as they darted behind bushes and old garden sheds. Milo, daring as always, crept toward the edge of the woods.

Toward the birch tree.

He disappeared into the darkness with a giggle, never noticing how the air grew still or how the cicadas suddenly fell silent. Minutes passed. Then longer.

Tessa called for him. The others joined in. When they found his hiding spot, all that remained was a slip of paper resting at the base of the birch.

In Milo’s scrawled handwriting, it read: *"Don’t look for me. It’s listening."*

# Chapter 2: Missing

The police were called. Search parties combed the woods. Dogs barked, flashlights flickered, and names were shouted into the night. But Milo was gone.

The birch tree remained silent, its pale bark glowing faintly under the moonlight. When they searched its base, they found no footprints, no broken branches, no sign anyone had even been there.

Except for the note.

# Chapter 3: The Whispering Wood

Days turned into weeks. Posters were hung, school resumed, and Milo became a name whispered in hallways and over dinner tables. Tessa, guilt-ridden and withdrawn, began visiting the birch every day.

She noticed things. The birds never perched in its branches. The ground around it was always dry, even after rain. And if she stayed long enough, she could almost hear voices. Whispers in the wind, just out of reach.

Her dreams grew strange—of Milo calling her from behind the tree, his voice muffled, as if coming from underground.

# Chapter 4: The Hollow

One twilight, Tessa returned to the tree alone. She pressed her ear to its bark and heard it: a faint scratching, like fingernails against wood. Then—a voice.

"Tess..." it murmured, so soft she nearly dismissed it. But it was Milo’s voice.

She circled the tree and found, hidden behind a veil of ivy, a narrow crack running down its trunk. Not large enough to see through, but enough to feel a breeze—an unnatural, cold draft.

# Chapter 5: The Journal

Determined, Tessa dug through the attic that weekend and found their grandfather’s old journal. He had grown up in Elmsbrook. One entry chilled her:

*“Never go near the birch. They say it’s a door. A thin place. They say something old listens from the other side.”*

Other entries told of children disappearing in the 1950s and 20s—always during the summer, always near the tree.

# Chapter 6: The Thing That Listens

Tessa returned again, this time with a tape recorder. She left it near the crack overnight. The next morning, she listened.

At first, only wind and rustling. Then a soft humming, followed by what sounded like a child crying. And then—

A deep, gravelly voice: *“You brought another.”*

She dropped the recorder.

---

# Chapter 7: Into the Hollow

Tessa couldn’t let it end there. That night, she returned with a flashlight and a crowbar. She widened the crack.

The bark tore away like wet paper, revealing a dark, twisting tunnel descending into the roots. The air reeked of soil and rot. She climbed in.

---

# Chapter 8: The Unseen World

Inside was a maze of earthen corridors, lit only by the pale glow of phosphorescent fungi. Whispers surrounded her.

She passed roots shaped like hands, faces molded in stone, and shadows that moved on their own. The air grew heavy, humming with strange energy.

Then she found it.

A cavern. In the center—Milo, asleep, roots gently coiled around him like veins. He was alive, but changed. Older. Tessa felt time shift around them.

---

# Chapter 9: The Voice

A presence emerged. Not a creature, but a shadow that filled the space. It didn’t speak with words but with thoughts.

It had listened to Elmsbrook for centuries. It fed on time, memory, and fear. Milo had wandered too close. Tessa had brought herself.

It offered her a choice: leave and forget, or stay and remember.

---

# Chapter 10: The Escape

Tessa chose to remember. She pulled Milo free, and the roots screamed.

They ran through collapsing tunnels, shadows reaching for them. The birch crackled above as the tree split down the middle, a blinding light erupting from its heart.

They tumbled out as the tree groaned and fell silent.

---

# Chapter 11: Return

Milo was never quite the same. He barely spoke. His eyes, once playful, now held centuries.

The tree was declared dead. No one went near it. Tessa told no one. But she remembered. Every word. Every whisper.

---

# Chapter 12: The Next Note

Years passed. Tessa grew up. The town forgot.

Until one summer night, another child vanished. At the base of where the birch once stood, a note appeared:

*“Don’t look for me. It’s listening.”*

---

# Epilogue

Some trees don’t die. They sleep. And in their sleep, they dream.

The birch will rise again.

And it will still be listening.
