# Prologue: White Noise

Late nights on KDRX 99.7 FM were usually uneventful. Darren Reeves, a former rock star now a solitary late-night DJ, played mellow tunes to an invisible audience of insomniacs, long-haul drivers, and fading dreamers. But on one particular October evening, as fog began to creep in off the coast, something changed.

The usual static shifted.

At precisely 2:07 a.m., the red light on the studio phone flickered. A voice barely audible through the interference requested a song Darren hadn’t thought of in decades. He remembered “Crimson Skies” by The Windwalkers—a track pulled from the airwaves after the lead singer’s suicide. Curiosity nudged him to spin the track.

As the music drifted into the empty station, a chill settled in the room. Then, during a lull between verses, Darren heard something else—softer than the music, not quite part of it. A whisper. A sob. A name. His mother’s name.

She had died ten years ago.

# Chapter 1: The First Call

The next night brought another voice. The line hissed with interference as a male voice rasped out a request for “Ashes to Ashes” by a band Darren vaguely remembered from his early teens. He hesitated. That song was rumored to have been inspired by a tragic car accident that killed two of the band members.

He played it.

As the final chorus ended, the phone rang again. This time, Darren answered with trepidation. A low female voice responded, her tone mournful. She spoke of singing that song on her last night alive, on a rainy highway, with the love of her life in the passenger seat.

She said Darren had driven past the wreck. He felt his blood run cold. He remembered the scene—a twisted car, covered in fog, and a feeling of unease that lingered for days.

# Chapter 2: Deep Cuts

The following nights blurred together. More requests came in. Obscure, unsettling, tied to accidents, suicides, disappearances. Each caller had a story—a last moment, a lost love, a funeral tune. Darren realized these weren’t just songs. They were soundtracks to deaths.

One man described the fire that took his record collection and his family. The song he asked for—“Burning Walls”—was never released commercially. Yet Darren found it, somehow, in the station’s archives.

The air grew colder with each play. Shadows deepened. And one night, the studio lights dimmed as Darren realized he was no longer alone.

# Chapter 3: The Girl in the Fog

On the fourth night, the fog outside was thicker than ever. Darren peered through the studio window and saw a figure standing across the street.

A girl. She wore a white dress, unmoving. Staring.

Back in the booth, the next call came from a trembling, youthful voice. She said she had drowned during a camping trip with her family. They had never found her body. Her request was “Drift,” a song Darren had once performed in his band days but never recorded.

“How do you know that song?” he muttered, heart racing.

The voice responded, “Because you sang it to me before I died.”

When he looked outside again, the girl was gone.

# Chapter 4: Reverb

The dreams began. Static-filled nightmares, dissonant voices, and phantom songs played backward. Each night, Darren awoke in sweat, with lyrics echoing in his head—songs he hadn’t heard since childhood.

He played one. As the haunting tune played, his phone lines exploded with calls. Some screamed. Others sobbed. One woman shouted that her dead husband was singing along in the kitchen.

A local obituary the next morning told of a woman who died during the broadcast. Official cause: heart attack. But the attending doctor noted ruptured eardrums and whispered something strange—“her brain was humming.”

# Chapter 5: DJ of the Dead

An email arrived from a former intern named Alexis. She warned Darren that this had happened before. Back in 1973, a DJ named Roy Tanner hosted the midnight slot. He began receiving similar calls.

Roy spoke of the fog, the whispers, and music that played itself. Then one night, during a live show, Roy vanished. The last words heard on air were: “They’re here.”

Darren researched further. There was no death certificate, no missing persons report—just a scribbled journal entry left in the station’s basement archives: “The songs are not ours.”

# Chapter 6: B-Side Séance

Darren invited a medium into the studio to try and make sense of it all. They began a séance at 2:00 a.m. The room chilled immediately.

The medium’s eyes rolled back as she muttered in several voices. “We sang our souls. Now we echo. We echo. We echo…” Then she collapsed, bleeding from the ears.

The speakers emitted a reversed melody—a warped version of “Crimson Skies.” In it, Darren’s own voice could be heard whispering things he had never said aloud.

# Chapter 7: Fog Files

Darren pieced together a map of every song request and caller. The connections were chilling. Every song correlated to a local death. All near the station. All during foggy nights. Most of the victims were declared missing, never found.

And each had one thing in common: they were reportedly listening to KDRX 99.7 at the time.

The realization hit Darren like thunder: the radio was a beacon.

# Chapter 8: No Commercial Breaks

He tried to shut down the show. Locked the studio. Unplugged the lines.

But at 2:00 a.m., the mic activated on its own. The studio door wouldn’t budge. Fog seeped in under the window frames.

Darren collapsed. When he woke up, the song “Crimson Skies” was playing again—this time in reverse. And outside, through the fogged window, he saw the girl in white… with dozens of others now behind her.

# Chapter 9: Silent Track

In desperation, Darren aired an hour of silence. But the listeners reported hearing songs anyway.

One claimed her father’s voice was singing to her, though he’d been dead five years. Another listener swore they heard the sound of drowning mixed into a melody.

A station technician noted something bizarre: Darren’s vocal frequencies, when recorded, began to overlap with those of past callers. Callers who were verified deceased.

# Chapter 10: The Missing Tape

A package arrived. No return address. Inside was an old reel-to-reel tape labeled “Tanner – Final Show.”

Darren played it.

There was only static at first. Then Roy Tanner’s voice emerged, frantic and whispering: “Don’t listen. Don’t play it. The songs… they feed.”

As the message ended, Darren felt a surge of heat through the mic. A deep, guttural voice echoed through the booth: “You are the DJ now.”

# Chapter 11: Broadcast from Beyond

The station signal changed. It began hijacking other frequencies. Listeners as far as neighboring cities reported hearing Darren’s show.

At 2:00 a.m., they heard songs not of this world. Incomprehensible lyrics. Notes that made animals howl. People began disappearing again. Always after hearing a particular track.

And now, Darren’s show ran on its own.

# Chapter 12: Dead Air

The booth was found empty. Everything was untouched, yet the mic was warm, and a low hum vibrated through the walls.

Darren’s journal sat open to a final entry: “I’m not the DJ anymore. I’m the static. I am the song.”

Each night, Line One blinks at 2:00 a.m. The fog returns. And the music begins again.

# Epilogue: Request Line

They say if you drive through fog with the radio on, you might hear a tune long forgotten—a lullaby, a heartbreak ballad, a funeral march.

Just don’t call the number.

Because if you do… they’ll start to sing about you.
