# The Lantern Keeper

“Every night at 3:33 AM, a flickering lantern appears in the woods near town. Those who follow it never return—but their whispers do.”

**Prologue**

They say it began long ago, back when the town of Black Hollow was still just a scattering of cabins along the river. No one remembers the exact year, only that it started with the sound of footsteps—soft, slow, and steady—accompanied by the glow of a lantern swaying through the darkness.

The legend grew with each generation. Some said the lantern was a warning, others a guide for lost souls. Children dared each other to stay up and watch for the light, but few had the courage to look out their windows after midnight.

Every night at 3:33 AM, it returns.

**The Light in the Trees**

Seventeen-year-old Lina Harrow had heard the stories her whole life. Her grandmother used to whisper them like prayers, warning her never to look outside after midnight.

Lina’s curiosity was stronger than her fear. She often wondered if the stories were just a way to keep children safe indoors, or if there was something truly waiting in the woods.

Lina never listened much. In her mind, the stories were just relics of a time when people feared shadows more than reality.

But curiosity, as always, is the spark behind every ghost story.

On a cold November night, she stood by her window and saw it—a single lantern bobbing in the woods behind her house. No one should’ve been there. No flashlight. No path. Just dense forest and that strange golden glow.

She pressed her face to the glass, heart pounding. The light moved in slow, deliberate arcs, as if searching for something—or someone.

Then… a whisper.

It wasn’t loud. Just a soft murmur, like someone speaking from the edge of sleep.

“Lina… come see…”

Her heart jolted. She stumbled back. It had spoken her name.

But when she looked again, the lantern was gone.

The next morning, Lina found a small, soot-stained feather on her windowsill. She picked it up, shivering, and tucked it into her journal.

**The Dare**

The next day at school, she told her best friend, Jamie. Of course, he laughed.

“It’s just an old ghost story, Lina. You probably dreamed it.”

But she hadn’t. She knew what she heard.

Later that night, Jamie dared her to go into the woods the next time the lantern appeared. “Film it. Prove it’s real,” he said with a grin. “We’ll be famous.”

So she did.

That night, Lina set an alarm for 3:25 AM. She dressed in layers, grabbed her phone, and crept downstairs. The house was silent, her parents asleep. She slipped out the back door, the cold biting at her cheeks.

At the edge of the woods, she waited. The world felt suspended, as if holding its breath. Then, at exactly 3:33, the lantern appeared.

It floated through the trees, its light golden and sickly, swaying with an invisible gait. No footsteps. No breathing. Just the rhythmic creak of the lantern’s chain.

And the whisper.

“Lina… this way…”

Against every instinct, she followed.

Branches clawed at her coat. The air grew colder with each step. The light drifted deeper into the woods, just out of reach. She ran to catch up—
And suddenly, the lantern stopped.

It hung in midair before her, flickering.

Then it turned.

There was no face. Just a shadow in a tattered cloak, with hollow eyes that wept smoke and a mouth that opened not to speak—but to scream.

Lina turned and ran. But the forest twisted. The trees moved. The path behind her vanished.

---pagebreak---

And the whispers came.

Not just one, but many.

Thousands of voices overlapping—some weeping, some begging, some calling her name.

“Lina… Lina… stay with us…”

She stumbled, falling to her knees. The ground was soft, almost spongy, and the air thick with the scent of smoke and old leaves. She pressed her hands to her ears, but the voices only grew louder.

A cold hand brushed her shoulder. She screamed, scrambling to her feet, and ran blindly through the trees.

⸻

**The Aftermath**

Her parents woke to her empty bed.

A search party found no footprints. No trail. Just her phone on the forest floor, still recording. The last thing it captured was a whisper:

“She walks with the Keeper now.”

**The Keeper Returns**

It’s been a year since Lina vanished.

But every night at 3:33 AM, the lantern returns. It floats just beyond the trees, swinging gently in the dark.

Some say they can hear her voice, just beneath the wind.

Others say the Keeper is collecting souls, one whisper at a time.

So if you ever find yourself in a quiet town near the woods…

And you see a flickering light at 3:33 AM—

Don’t follow.

Because even if you don’t return…

Your whisper will.
