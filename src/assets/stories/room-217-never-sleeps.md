# Page 1: Prologue

The Grand Marlowe Hotel had long since fallen into ruin. Once a gilded landmark of 20th-century luxury, it now stood abandoned, cloaked in ivy and silence. Only one room refused to decay: Room 217. Each night, a faint, bluish glow seeped from under its door. Locals whispered that sobbing echoed from within. But no one lived there. No one ever had. Not since the fire of '87.

And yet, every morning, the guestbook was found turned to a new page. A fresh signature. No footprints. No sign of entry. Only trembling words written in uneven hands. Some in ink. Some in blood.

Liam Cross had always sought adrenaline. Urban exploration was his drug of choice. When his friends dared him to spend the night in Room 217, he didn’t hesitate. With a GoPro on his chest and a cocky grin, he slipped through the broken window of the Grand Marlowe.

Inside, the air was stale. Furniture lay draped in white sheets, the smell of mildew saturating the halls. Yet Room 217’s door was clean, the brass numbers gleaming.

He stepped inside.

The air changed. It was warmer, humming with electricity. A desk sat in the far corner, the guestbook open. The bed was made, too neat, too fresh. Liam set up his camera and reclined. “Let’s see what all the hype is about.”

At 3:13 a.m., the camera caught the guestbook flipping pages by itself.

And then Liam began to sob.

In October 1987, the Grand Marlowe welcomed a school group for a weekend retreat. Among the children was twelve-year-old Jacob Grayson. Polite. Quiet. Troubled.

He was placed in Room 217.

That night, Jacob told his teacher he heard crying in the walls. She dismissed it as nerves. At 3:13 a.m., guests in the west wing awoke to flames. Screams echoed. The fire department arrived too late.

They never found Jacob.

The room where the fire began? Room 217.

Paranormal expert Dr. Elena Hurst had seen it all. Poltergeists. Demonic hauntings. Nothing prepared her for Room 217. Armed with thermal cameras and audio recorders, she entered with her assistant, Max.

Her equipment died upon entry. Max fled after seeing a reflection that didn’t match their movements.

Elena stayed.

She recorded herself whispering to something unseen. “They’re trapped. The children. They’re still here.”

Only the guestbook remained. Her name scrawled beside the phrase:

“I hear them in my bones.”

# Page 5: Chapter 4 - The Grieving Mother

Eleanor Grayson returned to the ruins nearly four decades after the fire. She’d never buried her son, Jacob. The authorities offered her a charred pair of glasses and a generic coffin. She never believed he was truly gone.

She entered Room 217 in the middle of the night.

Inside, Jacob’s backpack sat untouched on the desk. His handwriting on the walls—childish, repetitive: “Let me out.”

Eleanor dropped to her knees, sobbing. “I’m here, baby.”

The door closed on its own.

She was never seen again. But her lullaby can be heard near the door some nights.

Warren Vick designed the Grand Marlowe’s west wing. His private journal, found in a sealed floorboard, revealed disturbing blueprints. Room 217 had one anomaly: a sealed crawlspace behind the bedframe, never approved or documented.

His journal ended abruptly:

“They told me to make a room no one could leave. I didn’t understand until I heard them crying. Now I hear them every night. I’m sorry.”

When restoration crews broke into the wall in 2024, they found bones. Small ones.

Teen vloggers Mira and Lila Jenkins documented abandoned places. They livestreamed their visit to Room 217. Viewers watched as they joked, explored, then grew uneasy.

“Did you hear that?” Mira asked.

A long sobbing sound echoed through the room.

Only one girl made it out. Authorities found Lila curled outside, rocking and whispering:

“She’s still in there. But she’s smiling now.”

The guestbook had both names.

# Page 8: Chapter 7 - The Night Manager

In 1987, Harold Keys was the night manager. A known voyeur, he had peepholes drilled into Room 217. His notes—found in his locker—detailed “odd behavior.” Children speaking to shadows. Unseen lullabies.

After the fire, Harold vanished.

During renovations, workers found his corpse behind the mirror. His eyes were wide open. He’d carved a message into the glass with his fingernails:

“It watches. It remembers.”

# Page 9: Chapter 8 - The Bellhop’s Journal

Sam Reyes was seventeen when he worked the hotel in ‘87. His journal—discovered in the basement—recounted nights of hearing knocks from inside Room 217. He once peeked in and saw twelve children sitting on the bed. Still. Silent. Watching.

He wrote:

“They don’t blink. They remember you.”

Sam was last seen sprinting from the hotel, screaming. He left his shoes behind.

# Page 10: Chapter 9 - The Dreamer

Poet Aria Langley visited in 2001 seeking inspiration. She stayed overnight, scribbling verses feverishly.

The next morning, she was gone. Her final poem was found on the floor:

“The fire sleeps beneath the bed,
The room repeats what’s never said.
If sobbing stops, beware the light—
You’ll never make it through the night.”

The guestbook entry read only:

“I’m dreaming with my eyes open.”

# Page 11: Chapter 10 - The Medium

Famed psychic Doris Vale arrived with a team. She performed a cleansing ritual. Candles flickered violently. Her voice shifted mid-chant. Deep. Hollow.

“They sleep in pieces. They burn in time.”

She collapsed, eyes rolled back. When she awoke, she was blind.

Still, she whispered every night at 3:13:

“Room 217 never sleeps.”

# Page 12: Chapter 11 - The Return of Lawrence Vick

The remains found behind the wall in Room 217 were identified as Lawrence Vick—the original hotel manager. Rumors long held that he preyed on children. When the fire broke out, he was assumed to have fled.

But his skeleton was curled into a fetal position. No signs of external wounds. Internal damage was massive—every bone shattered from within.

The moment his remains were exhumed, Room 217’s light flickered… and grew brighter.

# Page 13: Chapter 12 - The Final Visitor

Dani Rivera, a YouTuber who vanished in Chapter 1, returned one rainy evening. Pale. Hollow-eyed. She walked barefoot into a police station holding the guestbook.

When asked where she had been, she said only:

“It’s not a room. It’s a collection. A hive. We’re all inside it now. Watching you.”

She vanished from her holding cell that night. Security footage showed her walking through the wall.

The guestbook is now kept under glass in a museum.

But each morning, it’s turned to a new page.

# Page 14: Epilogue - 3:13 A.M.

Some hear sobbing. Others, knocking. But if you dream of the room—always the same number—don’t open the door.

Because Room 217 never sleeps.

And it remembers you.
