# Room 217 Never Sleeps

Room 217 is always alive, no matter the hour. At midnight, the soft hum of the city outside fades, but inside the room, the glow of a laptop screen keeps the shadows at bay. The walls are lined with sketches, sticky notes, and dreams scribbled in ink. 

Sometimes, the radiator clicks and groans, as if it too refuses to rest. The gentle tapping of keys echoes through the night, punctuated by the occasional laugh or sigh. Even when the world outside is silent, Room 217 is filled with the quiet energy of ideas taking shape.

In the early hours, the first rays of sunlight slip through the curtains, painting golden stripes across the floor. Yet, the room is still awake, still buzzing with possibility. In Room 217, sleep is just a suggestion—there’s always another story to write, another thought to chase, another dream to bring to life.
